# Leah's Campaign
Write up 3 scenarios for Leah to choose from for her campaign

## Scenario 1:
You're a traveling adventurer looking for work. As you wander into the town of Tamers in the Pickingian League, you are approached by a young girl (around 4-6 years old) and she asks for your help in finding her parents. 

## Scenario 2: Current Favorite
While on an expeditious mission from King Riku of Alblewichia, you and your friend were captured in the Republic of Kexeter and sold as a slave to the Goblinoids of the Principality of Southbia. The King does not know and its up to you two to survive and make it back. 

### Backstory
King Riku sent you into the Republic of Kexeter as he believed they were going to launch a ground assault on the city of Southbou. In an effort to get the upper-hand, he has sent you to the city of Mareshead to see what kind of forces are gathering for the assault. While on the road to Mareshead, your team was ambushed by a group of slavers. They bound you and using their web of connections, transported you to the capital of the Wastelands of Gurborlaq, Boldonbydon, also known as the slave capital of the world. It is here that all manner of vile human- and goblinoids will beg, barter, and kill for slaves to help shore up the defenses of their fortresses and lands. You've just been won by a Tanaruuk, Gurlaq, who is ruler of the fort of Skiple. 

## Scenario 3:
You and your team of scouts have been recruited by the emperor of Harlish to infiltrate Zaoverinia and figure out what their next move is. You'll have a party of 3 other people to assist you as you sneak into high security buildings and figure out what they have in store for you next.

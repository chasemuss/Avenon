This is the story of [[Dretha]]

This song captures the harrowing and agonizing feeling of talking to a little girl who is worried about her mother that has gone out to find their father. The father is a hunter of beasts who tried to keep the streets safe during the nights of the hunt. The girl gives you a wind up music box and says that her daddy will recognize the music and if he hears it then he might come home. She also says that her mother wears a red jeweled broach. Well you end up fighting this man named "Father Gascoigne" who has gone mad from the influence of the "great ones" (lovcraftian monsters from your darkest dreams) and halfway through the fight he transforms into a werewolf. If you play the music box during that stage then gascoigne will writhe in pain as he screams and fights his memories. After defeating him you find a dead woman in the same area who was wearing a red jeweled broach.....

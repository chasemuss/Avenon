# Rachinoff
Rachinoff is an archmage at the [[Zaoverinia Conservatory#Necromancy|Zhoverinia Conservatory - Necromancy Division]]. He has been studying the very fundamentals of magic itself. His primary goal in this pursuit is to elevate himself to the point that he can utilize the magic of others. This effort is sponsored by the ruler of [[Zaoverinia]], [[Alexsei Grekov]], who wants to become a being of pure magic, able to manipulate how others can utilize the current of magic. 

Once he found out how to create the Tefraslangur, Rachinoff created a disease to help feed it. He created a plant-like magic to transport the spores of the Tefraslangur to other places, far and wide. 

# Rachinoff's Tefraslangur
Rachinoff's Tefraslangur is the end product of his research. This being of pure magic can manipulate the current of magic and bend it to its will. This grants The Tefraslangur the following abilities
- Use the spell slots of those under its control
- Use the hit points of those under its control
- Can regain spell slots by sacrificing the spell slot x 10 hit points. 

## The Battle
Have some lair actions while getting to the Tefraslangur

Once they get to the Tefraslangur, they see The Tefraslangur is surrounded by 6 wizards chained up above their heads. The wizards are emaciated and struggling to stay awake in their cages.

If the spell is 5th level or higher, The Tefraslangur makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell’s level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell’s level, the caster takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage if the spell fails.

## Tefraslangur's Curse
### Description
The Tefraslangur's Curse is a plant-like magic that Rachinoff made to help propagate those that would feed the Tefraslangur. It appears to be a neon green mushroom. When disturbed, it explodes into a cloud of spores, able to be moved around by wind to new places. If it cannot propagate within 7 days, it fades away. 

### Effects
When someone comes into contact with the disease, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or a DC 20 Constitution saving throw every long rest. 

On a success, the disease doesn't progress.

On a failure, the following occurs:
- If the diseased's wisdom is greater than 7:
	- The diseased loses 1 in Wisdom
	- The diseased gains 1 in Constitution
- If the diseased's wisdom is 7 or less, they become contagious, spreading the curse to anyone who touches them. 

If a fully diseased creature comes within 1 mile of Rachinoff's Tefraslangur, then they become subservient to its will. This enables him to use their spell slots and hit points as if they are his own. 

The disease can only be broken by the greater restoration spell or the defeat of the Tefraslangur.

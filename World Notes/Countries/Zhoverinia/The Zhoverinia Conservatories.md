While there are students that are focused on a single school of magic, must spend time in upwards to 5 different conservatories to learn more about the [[Current of Magic]]. The wizards that spend time in multiple schools tend to have a wide breadth of knowledge about the Current, but do not understand deeply what each school has to offer, while those that understand one school intimately may not understand the others very well.

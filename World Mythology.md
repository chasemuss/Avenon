The Prime Plane was forged by Theov at the beginning of the first era. He first created the [[Material Plane]]. In it, he created the humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes (including kender), halflings, and beasts. 

After the material world was made, he turned to that which would govern the world, Chaos vs Law & Good vs Evil, and made a ring of planes that would surround the Material Plane. In this ring, he assigned each element a station in the cosmology. 
- Water represents good
- Fire represents evil
- Earth represents law
- Air represents chaos

He took his hammer and forged the other gods. They quickly settled into their own areas of dominion, some fighting over who would rule what plane. They created countless creatures and sentient beings, or took others creations and twisted them to fit their ideals. 

Throughout all of this creation and explosion in magic, a Maelstrom formed above the Material Plane, and from it, Telli was born. The Goddess of Magic looked at the realms, and created the genasi and elementals as stewards of the planes. The other gods could not harm them directly.  

After Theov was done creating, he vanished for a thousand years, leaving the world in the hands of the gods he placed as stewards.  

In his absence, 4 rifts opened, 2 on each continent. 
* The South-Eastern rift led to the [[Islands of Paradise]], and from it all manner of merfolk, tritons, and aquatic creatures poured forth. 
* The North-Eastern rift led to the [[Fires of Mt. Perdition]], and from it, devils few out and began to influence the world
* The South-Western rift led to the [[Firestorm of Tartarus]], and from it, all manner of demons arrived to corrupt the land
* The North-Western rift led to the [[Fields of Elysia]], and from it, angels and Empyreans came forth to bring justice. 

| Compass | East         | West         |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| North   | Lawful Evil  | Lawful Good  |
| South   | Chaotic Good | Chaotic Evil |

The influence of these four rifts was felt across the material plane, and the gods that reside in the realms that they connected to began to exert their influence over the Material Plane.

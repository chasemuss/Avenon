The Kingdom of Bolandia is ruled by an evil wizard and his 4 governors. They use Toms of the Stilled Tongue to communicate.
- They use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. 
- They can use a bonus action to cast a spell they have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic components. Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.Â 
- While attuned to the book, they can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If they do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.
- The King watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.

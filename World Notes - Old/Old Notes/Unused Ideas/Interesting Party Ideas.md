# Dragon Riders
The party each start off with a dragon egg that they hatch & train and can use their bonus actions to control. Basically give each person the Ranger (Drakewarden) subclass features. Each dragon starts as a youngling, and whenever the dragon reaches in size in accordance with the Ranger (Drakewarden) schedule, the dragon grows to the next instance.
